Dear GitHub Community,

I am thrilled to announce the sharing of 3877 Malayalam verbs in Tamil text format. This resource aims to facilitate Tamil researchers in comprehending and analyzing Malayalam in Tamil script. It's important to note that Malayalam does not use the letter "ந"; instead, it employs "ன", and at the end, "ச்ச்" should be interpreted as "ச்சு".

We believe that this contribution will significantly aid researchers and enthusiasts alike. Thank you for considering our contribution. Should you have any inquiries or require additional information, please feel free to reach out.

Best regards,

Ingersol
